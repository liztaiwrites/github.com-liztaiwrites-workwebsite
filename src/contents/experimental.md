Now that Elon Musk has bought Twitter, are you going to leave the platform?

That's the question of the day (or week), but instead of answering that question, I'm going to steer you to another development taking place in the social media space. It is quiet, barely noticed, but it's happening.

Many people, many of them content creators, are getting tired of having their distribution channels dictated by the rules of the few. So, they are moving on to platforms that enable them to take more control of how they can reach their followers and readers.

The main appeal of these tools is that they are not algorithm-driven. Meaning, whether your content gets seen or not does not depend on the platform's distribution rules of the day. Instead, these are merely distribution tools to use.

For example, take Substack, a popular online tool used by millions of creators to send newsletters. If something happens to the platform, the rules change etc, users can take away their mailing lists to another platform that best suits their needs.

## The move from centralised platforms

For the last few weeks, I've been stumbling on more and more writers who are moving away from their blogs to write on Substack. Many say that they just "want to write more freely".

The usual advice you hear is that you should publish your content on your website: you own the content and have more control. But more and more content creators realise that Google is increasingly dominated by commercial bodies with deep advertising pockets. They can afford SEO experts to optmise their websites and content, most content creators can't. Email tools like Substack gives them the option to rise above that.

Fascinating times in the content world.

I've recently done the same, and I've never felt freer as a writer. And as a reader? Boy, I'm really excited by the content I'm reading from fellow creators. I realised with a start, how much effort it was beofre to find this content on Google search.

# TWitter chaos

I think that's why I'm not too concerned about Twitter as a user. I'll still be there. For now.

You see, I have always been strict with my feed. I follow a select few and mute content I find stressful or upsetting. As a result, my Twitter space is generally filled with fun, knowledge-sharing folks who don't stir up much drama.

You _can_ make Twitter a good place for you, but it will take work.

As a citizen of the world, however, I'm concerned about the increasing polarisation and disinformation I see online. I see people shouting at each other, refusing to listen to one another. I'm also worried that bad players with deep pockets could use this to their advantage. You know, like manipulate elections! I don't see how Elon is going to improve things. (I have my theories that algorithms, who tend to promote content that are more controversial, have played a part in this.)

I guess the answer to that Twitter question will be: Time can only tell.

Good luck, Twitterers.
