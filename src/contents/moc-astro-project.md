description: In which I, a non-developer, document my project to build a static website using Astro.

Can a non-developer build a static website? Some people enthusiastically say yes, but I have a feeling developers overestimate our abilities. Here's my journey to building a static website using the Astro framework.

# Project log

## [The future of social media is decentralised](/posts/fediverse-social-media)

My desire to build a static website was mostly filled by Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter. That was when I discovered not just the Fediverse, but the idea of static websites.

## [Why I chose Astro to build my static website](/posts/why-astro)

Why Astro? Why not Hugo, 11ty or more layman-friendly CMSes like Wordpress or Ghost? I lay out my journey to Astro here.
