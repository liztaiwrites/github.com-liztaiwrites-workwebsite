 Even bad jobs will move you forward in your life and career.

I don't regret the jobs I've had, even the ones with toxicity.

Every job taught me something important.

Every job gave me the skills to move forward to the position I have today.

Every job gave me new friends!

I think in the last five years since transitioning out from my comfort job - journalism - the no.1 skill I've learned the most is to be fearless when met with obstacles.

I used to say, "But I don't know how to do this!"

Today, I say, "I don't know how to do this, but let's find a way how to do it, shall we?"

Resilience is a precious skill to hone. :)
