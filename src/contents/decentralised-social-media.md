description: There's a move to move away from centralised social media to more walled, decentralised ones
---

Yesterday, I spoke about "walled" social media gardens. I think the same thing is happening to websites.

Static websites are getting more popular these days. Instead of relying on cloud-based web builders and content management systems to create dynamic websites, some tech-savvy users are building "static" websites that do not require databases.

This is pretty geeky stuff, mostly popular with folks who know some coding and are tech-savvy and at very early stages. These static website creators are trying to get more control - just like those building private social media gardens.

I believe we've reached a crossroads of sorts in the social media/Internet space. What I call the "fed up" point - users want alternatives. They want more control over their data. They want more control of what they read/see. They want freedom to create spaces that can reach their readers better. They want to remove middlemen.

In time, new technologies will spring up to cater to this desire.

From massive public media platforms to millions of walled gardens.

Imagine that!

I wonder how the media, advertising, marketing and PR industries will adapt to this decentralised field? Or will these private spaces have little impact?
