# What should you post on Linkedin?

Unpopular opinion: You need to be very careful about what you post on Linkedin.

For example, I know that Linkedin is a place where past, present and future bosses and colleagues dwell, so I'm more measured here.

That doesn't mean I tout a fake persona of myself. Instead, I'm very focused and strategic about my content. I share stuff that (I hope) will benefit my desired audience:

- The projects I am taking on to build my skills as a technical writer (for eg, currently I'm building a static website to beef up my HTML & CSS skills and learn JS and version control (Git)
- My experience with career change and less desirable bits of career management - managing toxicity at work
- Mental and physical health tips that will enable you to thrive at work
- Thoughts on writing and tech comms (social media, websites etc)

Note that I think about my audience's needs first, not my own.

Because we're all so different, there's really no right or wrong answer to "what should I post?".

For example, if you are a travel journalist, personal posts about your experiences will be great on Linkedin. People expect you to be personal.

However, if you are a CEO, you will probably be more cautious, as your posts could affect how people perceive your company and career.

The most important question to answer is this: Will this content benefit you, as an individual or a company, if you share it on Linkedin?

Because the wrong type of content could damage your personal brand. Unfortunately, even if it's your truth, the world is unfair, and people will judge you for it.

What do you think?
