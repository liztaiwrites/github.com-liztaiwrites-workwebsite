☝️ Getting ready for the shoot at Experian offices in Cyberjaya, Malaysia.

There's no greater feeling than to see a project come together. For the last few months, I've learned so much from organising and coordinating interviews and video shoots with The Malay Mail and the winning companies of the LIFE AT WORK Awards 2018.

It was a great privilege to be able to speak to the captains of the industry and the employees to learn how work-life practices have impacted their lives and transformed their organisations.
