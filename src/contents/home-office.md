I really like how my home office is coming together. This is the place that I not only do my work as a Tech Writer for my current company, but also a place to journal, write blog posts for my personal website, write fiction and more. So, I wanted it to be an efficient and comfortable place. Here are my fav things in the space:

**Stand-up desk convertor**: Instead of an expensive stand-up desk, I got a convertor which I can place on top of any table. I can raise it and lower it manually, and very easily too. It cost me about RM600+.

üí∫ **Office chair**
I thought of buying one of those fancy RM1.5K ergonomic chairs. Then, I realised I didn't really want to encourage myself to sit longer than 30 minutes at a time. So, I settled on "budget" RM350 chair. It's comfortable enough, but not too comfortable that I forget to stand up and move.

**Writing desk**: This is the table where I do my more reflective work like journaling. I have a view of the hills from here, so it's perfect!

**White board**: I've always wanted one! Just a place to put reminders and doodle my dreams.

**Mechanical keyboard**: I got it off Carousell for a steal. I love the tactile sensation when I type and the klikity-klakity noises it makes. It will be murder (or I will be murdered) in open offices, so I am glad I have a home office where I can indulge!

**Footstool**: Got this RM70 adjustable one after getting tired of using boxes. :P Yes, I'm not tall.

**CPU**: This is my gaming machine! NGL, it's awesome to have an extra machine just in case.

üñ•Ô∏è **A monitor**: Two screens is the way to go for productivity!

Note that I didn't put a couch in this space. It'll be far too tempting for me to lie on it and not do work!

It took me a while to put together this space. And if I add all the money I've spent on the furniture and tech, it will easily surpass RM12k, methinks!

Fortunately, I don't think I need to add anything else to this space. Except, perhaps, 2 cats - one that will sit on my writing desk to stare at the birds outside, and another that will sit on my keyboard, preventing me from working.
