What if you made a career decision but then realised it was the wrong move? What do you do?

12 years ago, I jumped from #journalism to #nursing. Like, actual bedside nursing. I quit my job of 12 years, flew to Australia, got a grant for my studies and began working as a nursing assistant in Adelaide. Talk about life change, right?

I decided to start at the bottom of the profession because I wanted to see if the career was for me before committing to an RN degree.

It turns out that I had the qualities to be a good nurse (cool head during emergencies, high tolerance for blood and gore) but I found the physical and emotional aspects of the job draining and painful.

(This, by the way, is sadly common - many bedside nurses often leave due to this.)

After 2+ years, I ditched my plans to pursue an RN degree and embarked on a career in digital marketing.

It wasn't easy to make another massive life change. I wrestled with feelings of failure and "I told you so's" from people. Many thought I was stupid to leave Australia ("What a waste! So many people want PR you know!")

Some colleagues in my management consutlting company have a saying: "Failure is an opportunity for redirection."

Ducking out of nursing may seem like failure at first, but I grew so much from my years in healthcare and then the pivot to #contentmarketing #contentstrategy.

When we think of life as a series of experiments, and realise that it takes many tries to get something right, we won't be as afraid of changes.

So, if you took a gamble and it didn't work out, please don't be hard on yourself. Not all our decisions end up being gold.
It's not a failure to quit or if something doesn't work out. It's a redirection.
