![National Geographic social media snafu](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5622AQHhJibroA44rQ/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1661727141767?e=1676505600&v=beta&t=LpyiceURNGO-orhobMVagUhRFQg9nDhd_VCv5FhkjD0)

Am I the only one thinking, "The poor social media manager!" ?

If you're wondering what's wrong with the caption - well, pop quiz, Singapore is not a part of Malaysia. The irony of National Geographic making a mistake about geography is, well, too delicious to ignore, so this post has gone viral.

I've managed social media accounts for nearly 5 years, and the pressure is unbelievable. You are expected to produce content and respond/react to comments at an unholy rate. One social media post is a project in itself, and often requires coordination between many internal departments.

On top of this, the sad fact is many social media managers are one-man-shows - they have to do the content creation, publishing and community management by themselves. This is a profession where the burnout rate is high. Many SMMs are leaving the profession altogether.

One of the organisations I worked for was linked to the government , so each tweet and retweet carried serious weight. Fortunately, I had a team under me, and that made the pressure more manageable. However, before they came along, I was doing it solo! Crazy pressure. I lived in dread wondering if any of my posts would end up going viral for not great reasons.

So I'll give National Geographic's social manager a bit of a break. It could be a crazy day. A crazy month.

Or well, they need to brush up on their geography lessons.
