Part of my job is to do the live social media updates for an event. And I love it! Even if you are a small company, you can do this. Just some tips:
ðŸ‘‰ inform your followers you are doing live updates in advance
ðŸ‘‰ have a plan - know what you are going to share in advance - write the copy if you can
ðŸ‘‰ Make a list of the people or companies you need to tag
ðŸ‘‰ create an event hashtag
ðŸ‘‰ Make sure you have a place to sit and have an Internet connection - basic, but so easy to forget
