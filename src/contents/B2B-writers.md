description: B2B writers are often paid more, but what makes them so special?

I think there's a lot of mystique around #B2B marketing. People tend to think of it as difficult. I've been told that a lot of copywriters even avoid the industry as it's not as fun as #B2C.

There's no denying that there's a learning curve involved when you write about subject matters such as Digital Transformation or Internet of Things, but it's not impossible to skill up. And if you've been working in the content space for some time, you would have had some transferable skills already.

Here are the skills you need to be a B2B writer:

- strong writing & editing skills (a given)
- a strong passion to constantly learn
- a strong foundation in business/technical knowledge\*
- the ability to research strategically
- the skill to distill complex information into content that will grip the reader's attention
- the ability to write in your target audience's language\*

The ones marked \* is what distinguishes B2B from B2C writers, and why they tend to be paid more. And why those who have written more B2C content can struggle ... at first.

## How to be a B2B writer

Because that was me. I've spent years writing about entertainment, lifestyle, social and environmental issues as a journalist. In my early years ,I avoided business content like the plague, a carry on from my secondary school years where I was bored out of my mind with Economics and Accountancy classes.

When I ended up in B2B writing, I felt like a foreigner in a new land where people spoke a different language.

I was pretty overwhelmed. All the jargon, all the terms ... I felt as if I was suddenly in a land where everyone spoke a different language.

I faced a lot of pressure to learn quickly because, well, one of my first projects was to write a white paper on an SaaS virtual twin software! The industry? Healthcare.

Well, okay, at least I knew healthcare - I worked in it for 3 years, after all.

But it didn't make it any easier.

The thing about B2B, or with learning anything challenging is this - there will be a period where you think you will never ever be able to understand what you need to learn. You'll feel like giving up.

Alas, a lot of people will give up.

What you need to do, instead, is to push through and cultivate an attitude of curiosity and wonder. Don't let the panic and worry take over - focus on the fascinating details of this new industry or solution that you have to write about.

Over time, God willing, something will click and you will just "get it".

I still have a lot to learn, however. But if you're trying to get into #B2Bmarketing or are just starting out, let's cheer each other on ;)

What helped me scale up quickly to competency was my ability to research strategically and distill complex information quickly.

What I mean by "researching strategically" is not just having great Google-fu skills, but the ability to organise your research in such a way that you can refer and digest them quickly. But that's a conversation for another day!

## Companies need to empower B2B writers too

However, don't just depend on their skills alone - companies, please provide your content writers the support they need! So, if you are hiring B2B writers, remember to give them:

- access to subject matter experts
- time to absorb complex information
- onboard them thoroughly on your company products/services
- the freedom to ask questions

Successful B2B content writing happens when there's a harmonious marriage of skills + support. The mistake I often see is to put the burden 100% on the writer; a B2B writer is a skillful professional, but he/she is still not an expert in supply chain management, for example.

They can Google-fu their way to write a white paper, but that will be distillation of _other_ people's ideas instead of your company's expertise. That will be quite a shame. (And a disaster if it happens to be your competitor's ideas!)
