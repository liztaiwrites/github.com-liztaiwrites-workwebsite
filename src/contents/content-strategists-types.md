description: UX Content Strategists and Content Marketing strategists - what makes them different?
---

There are generally 2 types of content strategists

- UX Content Strategist (now called Content Designer)
- Content marketing strategist (CS)

These two are often confused for each other. And sometimes, it is unsurprising to do _both_. (Case in point: Me back in 2020-2022!)

It's tough to distill what a content strategist does in one social media post. And not all CS roles are the same. The CS's job is to make sure that the content meets a user's needs and a company's business objectives. (Read: More leads!)

The Content Deisgner (CD) on the other hand, makes sure that the machine where content is distributed out from is set up & maintained well so that the content does what it needs to do and gives users a good experience. The machine is usually the website but include other platforms. That's again, terribly simplistic.

If a business was a bakery, the CS will be the person at the front of the shop figuring out a way to get more customers into the shop. Should they print ads? Should someone stand in the front of the store and holler?

The CD's job is to make sure that the shop will give the customers a great experience when they come in. Are the customers' needs served while they're shopping or after they get the goods?

As a CS, a good portion of my job entails strategising content. Planning skills are a must; writing and editing well is a given. Being a T-shaped marketer would be advantageous but not necessary, but CS's must understand how each part of the marketing machine contributes to business goals.

But most of all, and one that cannot be overlooked: They must have excellent people skills.

Stakeholder management is key in this role because you'll be working with cross-functional teams. You need to be able to empathise with their challenges/needs and yet be the no.1 advocate for your target audience.

It's a delicate dance, and sometimes things get tense and challenging, but it's the CS's role to keep a cool head and still get what he/she needs from all these departments to produce content that will snag the business more opportunities.

Personally, I think this is the most important skill a CS should have. Project management and marketing tactics can be taught. Stakeholder management skills come from experience.

Knowing the difference between the various content professions will help manage expectations; the job applicant will know what he/she is getting into, recruiters would know skills to look out for & hiring managers will get the team member they need.
