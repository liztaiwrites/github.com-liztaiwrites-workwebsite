description: Explaining what technical writers do
---

I am a Technical Writer.

I'm the person who creates software documentation. The simplest explanation for what I do is that I help users use software with content. Let's say you want to build a Squarespace website. One of the documents that you probably would look at are User Guides, usually nestled in the Help section. That's an example of what I create day in day out.

I explored various content careers in previous posts. Today, I'll talk about the fascinating #technicalwriting field.

It's a common misconception that tech writers write all day. On the contrary, I find myself testing software a lot. This is something I really love to do even if it can sometimes be an exasperating process!

You're probably wondering, just how "techy" must I be to be a technical writer?

Most people will say, you don't have to have lots of tech knowledge to enter the field. (Meaning, you don't need to know how to code etc)

However, the truth is, tech writers should have _some_ tech knowledge. They need to be agile enough to understand tech jargon, systems and ways of working quickly.

For example, my coding knowledge has rusted to the point of, well - if everyone is driving electric cars now, I'm still driving a jalopy! However, that foundation has served me well. That and my obsession learning new software and building websites. (I think I burnt through all the productivity apps created by Silicon Valley at this point.)

So ... you don't need to be techy. But you need to be techy "enough".

If you have any questions about technical writing, feel free to ask me, but I'm still a relative n00b in the field and have lots to learn. ;)

- Technical writers don't just work in software. Many work in medical sciences, engineering firms etc.
