title: "Experienced technical writer, content strategist and B2B writer"
---

I currently work as a technical writer for the software company, ServiceRocket. However, I have over 20 years of experience as a content strategist, journalist and B2b writer. I’ve written content for the media, businesses big and small, and agencies.

I'm a very versatile writer who can write on almost any topic. However, I specialise in writing content for these niches: B2B (SaaS, technology and business), personal finance, and lifestyle.
